# Kindle Bibliotheca
Welcome to the Kindle Bibliotheca .NET Web API repository! This application simulates an online free library with books available in more formats, destined for Kindle devices. It uses .NET and Angularframeworks. It was my first personal project as I tried to improve my Angular knowledge while learning more about how endpoints should be structured in the back-end and what are their dependencies


## Features
- Browse the books in the library with a paginated view(data retrieved from .json seed files)
- Search books by title
- Filter books by authors and series
- Sort books in various orders
- Upload books(.pdf format)
- Download books(if they are already uploaded)
